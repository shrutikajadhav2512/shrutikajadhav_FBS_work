# Develop a simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations (+,
# -, *, /) on two numbers provided by the user. The program should ask the user for
# the numbers and the operator. However, the program should handle the following
# exceptions:
# a. Invalid Number: If the user enters a number that is not valid, catch the
# exception and display an error message.
# b. Invalid Operator: If the user enters an operator other than "+", "-", "*", or
# "/", catch the exception and display an error message.
# c. Division by Zero: If the user tries to divide by zero, catch the exception and
# display an error message.
# Write a program that performs the requested arithmetic operation and
# handles the exceptions as described above.
